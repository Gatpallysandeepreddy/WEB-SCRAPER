# WEB-SCRAPER

A simple Python script to scrape news headlines from a given website and save them to a text file.

## Features

- Fetches headlines (from `<h2>` tags) from a news website.
- Falls back to `<title>` tags if no `<h2>` headlines are found.
- Saves all fetched headlines to a plaintext file (`headlines.txt`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gatpallysandeepreddy/WEB-SCRAPER.git
    cd WEB-SCRAPER
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python scrape_headlines.py
    ```

    By default, it fetches headlines from [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news).

3. To scrape a different news site, edit the `url` variable in `scrape_headlines.py`:

    ```python
    url = "https://example.com/news"
    ```

4. After running, you’ll find the scraped headlines in `headlines.txt`.

## Customization

- Change the target site by modifying the `url` variable.
- Edit the HTML tag(s) in the `fetch_headlines()` function to suit the structure of your target site.
